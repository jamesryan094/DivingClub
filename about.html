        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">
            Bubble Under</span> is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the
            summer months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small
            groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel, and to ensure that
            everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
        <p> Although we’re based in the south-west, we don’t stay on our own turf: past diving
            weekends have included trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta’s numerous wreck sites.</p>
        <p> When we’re not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to
            talk about our recent adventures (<em>any excuse, eh?</em>).</p>
        <p>As out old friend Bob Dobalina would say:</p>
        <blockquote class="fun">
            <p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of
                Old Speckled Hen. You can quote me on that!</p>
            <p>"Join us for a weekend away at some of our favorite dive
                spots and you'll soon be making new friends.</p>
            <p>"Anyway, about time I got on with some <em>proper</em>
                work!"</p>
        </blockquote>
